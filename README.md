## Overview

Engineer behind Vanta Systems — a structured Discord + Roblox infrastructure stack focused on identity correlation, audit logging, and scalable bot architecture.

Primary interests:

- Distributed Discord bot systems
- Roblox ↔ Discord identity linking
- Evidence registry architecture
- Role-gated permissions
- Internal API design
- Deployment automation

---

## Core Competencies

### Backend
- TypeScript (advanced)
- Node.js runtime internals
- Express / Fastify APIs
- REST architecture design
- Middleware systems
- Authentication flows (OAuth, key-based auth)
- Rate limiting + validation (Zod)

### Databases
- MongoDB (schema modeling, indexing, aggregation)
- SQLite (lightweight registry systems)
- Data normalization strategies
- Audit log persistence design

### Discord Systems
- discord.js (slash commands, interactions, embeds)
- Role-based access gating
- Component-driven UI (buttons, pagination)
- Watchlist logging systems
- DM-based log delivery
- Shard-aware design concepts

### Roblox Integration
- Identity verification bridging
- External API consumption
- Group + friend analysis
- Risk indicator modeling
- Cross-platform data correlation

### Infrastructure
- Railway deployments
- Cloudflare Workers
- Environment management
- Service heartbeat monitoring
- Status persistence
- Production debugging

### Architecture Patterns
- Layered service separation (bot / API / dashboard)
- Typed contracts between services
- Event-driven logging
- Minimal runtime assumptions
- Explicit permission boundaries
